# Face-recoginition
In todayâ€™s world, face recognition is an
important part for the purpose of security and
surveillance. Hence there is a need for an efficient and
cost effective system. Our goal is to explore the
feasibility of implementing Raspberry Pi based face
recognition system using conventional face detection
and recognition techniques such as Haar detection and
PCA. This paper aims at taking face recognition to a
level in which the system can replace the use of
passwords and RF I-Cards for access to high security
systems and buildings. With the use of the Raspberry Pi
kit, we aim at making the system cost effective and easy
to use, with high performance
